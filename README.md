# FireProtect – IoT-Based Smart Fire Detection & Alert System

FireProtect is an intelligent fire detection and monitoring system that combines _IoT, MQTT-based real-time communication and Machine Learning_ to provide rapid fire detection, dynamic alerts and remote monitoring.

The system utilizes multiple environmental sensors connected to an ESP32 microcontroller for continuous monitoring. A hybrid Machine Learning architecture consisting of a _Decision Tree (Edge Model)_ and _Random Forest (Backend Model)_ improves detection accuracy while reducing false alarms. Real-time sensor data is transmitted through MQTT to a live web dashboard, while ThingSpeak serves as a backup cloud platform for data logging and retrieval.

## 1. Project Overview

FireProtect is an IoT-enabled smart fire detection and alert system designed for real-time monitoring, intelligent fire classification, and rapid emergency response.

Unlike traditional fire alarms that rely solely on threshold-based detection, FireProtect combines multi-sensor data fusion, MQTT communication, and Machine Learning to accurately classify events as:
- Actual Fire
- False Alarm
- Safe Condition

### Key Features

- Multi-sensor fire detection using Flame, Gas, Temperature, Humidity, and Motion sensing
- Hybrid Machine Learning architecture for intelligent fire classification
- MQTT-based real-time communication with low latency
- Edge-based fire prediction on ESP32
- Instant local alarm and relay activation
- Live monitoring dashboard with location tracking
- ThingSpeak backup cloud integration
- Historical data logging and incident monitoring

---

## 2. System Workflow

1. Sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions.
2. ESP32 collects readings from:
   - MQ-2 Gas Sensor
   - Flame Sensor
   - DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
   - PIR Motion Sensor
3. Sensor data is processed locally using Decision Tree-based edge logic.
4. Events are classified as:
   - Actual Fire
   - False Alarm
   - No Fire
5. If a fire risk is detected:
   - Buzzer activates immediately
   - Relay-controlled safety devices are triggered
6. Sensor readings and alerts are published to the MQTT broker.
7. The web dashboard receives real-time updates via MQTT.
8. The backend Random Forest model performs secondary validation.
9. Sensor data is stored in ThingSpeak for backup and historical analysis.
10. Users can monitor alerts, predictions, and sensor values through the dashboard.

## 3. Hardware Architecture & Sensor Programming

### Hardware Components
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|------------|
| ESP32 | Central processing and communication unit |
| MQ-2 Gas Sensor | Smoke and combustible gas detection |
| Flame Sensor | Flame detection using infrared sensing |
| DHT11 Sensor | Temperature and humidity monitoring |
| PIR Sensor | Human motion detection |
| Buzzer | Local emergency alert |
| Relay Module | Controls external safety devices |
| Power Supply | Stable system power source |

### Sensor Programming
- ESP32 initializes all sensors and communication modules.
- Continuous sensor acquisition is performed in real time.
- GPIOs are configured for sensor inputs and actuator outputs.
- Sensor values are analyzed using threshold logic and Decision Tree rules.
- Hazard conditions trigger immediate local actions.
- Sensor readings are simultaneously transmitted via MQTT and uploaded to ThingSpeak.

### Local Safety Actions
- Buzzer activation
- Relay switching
- Emergency event generation
- MQTT alert publishing

The system remains operational even during internet outages through local edge processing.

3. Monitoring remains uninterrupted.
4. Historical records remain accessible.

This ensures continuous monitoring even during network failures.
